# From Soup to Nuts

* In this activity, you will perform basic scraping of HTML.

* Create a new Jupyter notebook, and import BeautifulSoup into it.

* Open `html-tags.html` in VS Code. Copy and paste the code into your Jupyter notebook as a Python string. Use triple quotation marks, as it will be a multi-line string.

```python
html = """
<html code>
"""
```

* Parse the HTML code with BeautifulSoup.

* Use BeautifulSoup to extract the following:

  * The `head` element.

  * The first `h1` element, then its text.

  * The first `h2` element's text.

  * The first anchor, then its `href` attribute.

  * The first `ul` element, and its first list item, as well as the list item's text.
