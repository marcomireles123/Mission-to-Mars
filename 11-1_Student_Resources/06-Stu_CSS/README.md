# CSS

## Instructions

* In a new HTML file, create three [ordered lists](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_ordered.asp). Each list should have four items.

  * The first should be a list of four cities. The entire list should have an `id` of "cities".

  * The second should be a list of four food entrees. Two of them should contain meat, and two of them should be vegetarian. The meat list items should have a `class` called "meat". The vegetarian list items should have a `class` called "vegetarian".

  * The third should be a list of four movies. Your favorite movie on that list should have an `id` called "favorite". Only that list item should have an `id`.

* In the `style` section, use CSS selectors to color your target elements.

  * Color the entire list of cities purple.

  * Color the meat-containing dishes brown, and the vegetarian dishes green.

  * Color your favorite movie orange.
