# My First HTML

In this activity, you will create a simple HTML page.

## Instructions

In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include in it the following:

* `DOCTYPE` declaration

* `head` tag with nested `title` tag

* `h1` tag with a title of your choice

* An image

* A link to an external page, such as google.com

* An ordered list of things to do in your next vacation

* An unordered list of four bands/musicians you like. To create an unordered list, use the `<ul>` tag.

* You should be checking the rendered HTML in a web browser as you code to make sure you're going in the right direction.
